## ðŸ¤“About Me

 I am currently a research intern at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/), supervised by Dr. [Shaoli Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o31BPFsAAAAJ). I just graduated from  the College of Information Engineering, [Northwest A&F University](https://zhshw.nwsuaf.edu.cn/), China as an outstanding graduate in Jun. 2024 and obtained the Masterâ€™s  degree. 

 My research topic is 3D vision, with a particular focus on ***3D Human motion generation and Hand Pose estimation***. Previously, I focused on high-level vision, e.g., object detection/segmentation and computer vision in agriculture.

 I am excited to apply for ***2025 PhD*** programs.
